				Nature provides man with everything necessary for his existence. But, often we do not appreciate these gifts, without hesitation, we pick flowers and branches on trees, without giving anything in return. It seems to us that this is a trifle, because new ones will grow. Turning around, it's hard not to notice - how beautiful nature is after all. We just need to learn to appreciate it!

				Nature pleases us with its unusual and so different seasons. In the spring, as if taking the first steps, nature is renewed, sprouts appear on the ground, followed by the first leaves on the trees. By the summer, in the forests and gardens, a real riot of colors, flowers and shrubs flourished. In autumn sometimes crowns of trees with crimson and golden fireworks decorate alleys and parks. Golden autumn covers everything around with a yellow carpet of falling leaves. The arrival of winter replaces rains with snowfalls. Lakes are frozen over, trees are wrapped in white fur coats. Queen Winter comes into her possession and until spring, nature seems to fall asleep.

				In recent years, environmental protection has received increasing attention. This pleases and means that there are more and more people who are not indifferent to the future of our Planet, who show help and care for the nature around us. Preserving and preserving the pristine beauty of the Native Land is our common duty and obligation!
